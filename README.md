# Artistic-Rendering-of-Digital-Images

An Image Processing Project for generating an artistic image by using 2 different images which one of them is source and the other is target image. 


Some example source, target and output images can be seen on the files. Also, a paper has been prepared in IEEE Standards which you can see the general algorithm of our technique.

The code is not well-optimized yet. It may take a while around 7-10 minutes to process the output image.
